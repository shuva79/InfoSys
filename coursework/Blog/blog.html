                    <h3>Negative Impact: </h3>
                    <p>Communication has now become instant, and unfortunately, many individuals have not taken the time to analyze its effect on their lifestyles. Those with families have the spouse and the children waiting for them after being in the office the entire day. Unfortunately, such people arrive home, and the next minute, they are on their computers checking the latest updates from Facebook and emails. When they are done, the next thing is switching on the TV. This leaves no time for the family because the definition of the word `relaxation’ has changed. To have thousands of friends on a social network like Facebook is not important, considering that there is no face-to-face interaction.</p>
