                Technology is a vital component of life in the modern world. People are so dependent on technology that they cannot live without it. Technology is important and useful in all areas of human life today. It has made life easy and comfortable by making communication and transport faster and easier (Harrington, 2011, p.35).
                
                It has made education accessible to all, and has improved healthcare services. Technology has made the world smaller and a better place to live. Without technology, fulfilling human needs would be a difficult task. Before advent of technology, human beings were still fulfilling their needs. However, with technology, fulfillment of needs became easier and faster.
                
                It is unimaginable how life would be without technology. Technology is useful in the following areas: transport, communication, interaction, education, healthcare and business (Harrington, 2011, p.35). Despite its benefits, technology has negative impacts on the society. Examples of negative impacts of technology include development of controversial medical practices such as stem cell research, and the embracement of solitude due to changes in interaction methods. For example, social media has changed the way people interact.
                
                Technological has led to introduction of cloning, which is highly controversial because of its ethical and moral implications. The growth of technology has changed the world significantly, and has influenced life in a great way. Technology is changing every day and continuing to influence areas of communication, healthcare, governance, education and business.</p>
